The architecture of this web application is utilizing React as the base of it. React has a template website that allows for people to take that, and then expand upon it how they wish.

I took React's template website, and then installed MaterialUI (MUI) as well with it, to have a very uniform look and feel to the website, that I can customize even easier than with stock CSS code.
